# Best-Model-for-Stock-price-prediction
# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction â€“ Model Comparison

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to *predict stock prices* and *compare different deep learning models* to identify the *best-performing model*.  
We used data from *Tata Motors, Reliance, and Amazon* and trained four models:

- ðŸ”¹ RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)  
- ðŸ”¹ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)  
- ðŸ”¹ CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)  
- ðŸ”¹ Hybrid CNN + LSTM  

The models were compared using *RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)* and *MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)*.  
The best model is selected based on the *lowest RMSE*.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Stock data downloaded using **[Yahoo Finance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)**.  
- Time range: *2015 â€“ 2025*  
- Features used:
  - Open, High, Low, Close, Volume  
  - Moving Average (MA10, MA50)  
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA20)  
  - Returns

## âš™ Models Implemented
1. *RNN* â€“ Simple recurrent layers.  
2. *LSTM* â€“ Long short-term memory units to capture long dependencies.  
3. *CNN* â€“ 1D convolution for feature extraction.  
4. *CNN+LSTM* â€“ Hybrid model combining CNN feature extraction with LSTM sequence learning.

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics
- *RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)* â€“ Measures average prediction error.  
- *MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)* â€“ Measures percentage error.  

Formula:  
\[
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum (y_{true} - y_{pred})^2}
\]  
\[
MAPE = \frac{100}{n} \sum \left| \frac{y_{true} - y_{pred}}{y_{true}} \right|
\]
